# kofta-lang

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.1.3. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.

# TODO

1. Make a strict type system?
2. Improve syntax
3. Make .kft files runnable (Maybe add syntax highlighting too?)
4. Add logical operators
